Given an array of n integers where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. 
Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. 
There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that: 

Each student gets one packet.
The difference between the number of chocolates in the packet with maximum chocolates 
and packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56} , m = 3 
Output: Minimum Difference is 2 

Explanation:
We have seven packets of chocolates and 
we need to pick three packets for 3 students 
If we pick 2, 3 and 4, we get the minimum 
difference between maximum and minimum packet 
sizes.

Input : arr[] = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12} , m = 5 
Output: Minimum Difference is 6 

Explanation:
The set goes like 3,4,7,9,9 and the output 
is 9-3 = 6

Input : arr[] = {12, 4, 7, 9, 2, 23, 25, 41, 
30, 40, 28, 42, 30, 44, 48, 
43, 50} , m = 7 
Output: Minimum Difference is 10 

Explanation:
We need to pick 7 packets. We pick 40, 41, 
42, 44, 48, 43 and 50 to minimize difference 
between maximum and minimum.
